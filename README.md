# FreedomHouseDataScienceProject
First Official Data Science Project involving Freedom House Data from freedomhouse.org

**Description of the Project**
- Developed using Python with the csv, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Beautiful Soup libraries 
- Cleaned, processed, visualized, and analyzed datasets provided by Freedom House of “freedom status”, “freedom scores”, and sub-scores that determine the freedom scores and thus freedom status of every world country from 2010 to 2018 to analyze change of democratic governments among countries throughout the years
- Developed and executed a linear regression model that determines future “freedom scores” of each country in the next 10 years or so starting from 2019 to determine countries that are high in-risk in becoming “not free” or non-democratic and countries with declining democracies.
