# FreedomHouseDataScienceProject
First Official Data Science Project involving Freedom House Data from freedomhouse.org

**Description of the Project**
- I extracted, cleaned, and processed datasets of "freedom scores" and basic information of every world country recorded issued by the Freedom House organization. 
- I implemented linear regression to predict future "freedom scores" of every country in the next ten years from 2019. 
- I programmed in Python, and utilized its csv, SciPy, NumPy, Matplotlib, and BeautifulSoup libraries. 
- In this project, I learned about linear regression, and certain Statistics concepts such as correlation.
